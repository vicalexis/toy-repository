# toy-repository
This repository is for helping students gain experience with git and github.

## Steps
1. At the start, this repository is empty. As groups add information to the repository, it will be more populated. 
2. Each member of a team forks this repository into your own github account. 
3. One member of the team will add a directory with a README.md file for the group. If you do not add the README.md file (and it cannot be empty), then the directory will not show up. The name of the directory should be `groupxx`, where `xx` is replaced by the group number. The group number is `01`, or `02`, etc. 
  - Then, the person in the group who creates the group number should push those changes to their fork, and issue a pull request back to this repository. 
  - Once the pull request is accepted, each member of the group should update their own fork using a pull request. 
4. Each member of the team should than add a file in their group's directory, named `pawprint.md`. In that file, they should include: 
  - One reference for learning more about git that they found helpful
  - A link to an open source project that they think is interesting. 
  - When the information is updated, the member should implement a new pull request to submit their file back to the general repository. 

  
## Notes
1. This activity is designed to illustrate how git works, and how github works, without introducing any reasonable likelihood that your commits will conflict with anyone elses.
